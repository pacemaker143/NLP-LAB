# Text Preprocessing and TF-IDF Feature Representation

## Overview
This project implements a complete **text preprocessing and feature extraction pipeline** used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The goal is to convert raw textual data into structured numerical representations suitable for machine learning and information retrieval tasks.

The workflow includes **text cleaning**, **lemmatization**, **stop-word removal**, **label encoding**, **TF-IDF vectorization**, and **saving processed outputs** for reuse.

## Processing Steps

### Text Cleaning
Raw text is normalized by converting all characters to lowercase, removing punctuation and non-alphabetic characters, and eliminating extra whitespace. This step reduces noise and ensures consistency across the dataset.

---

### Lemmatization
Lemmatization is applied to reduce words to their base or dictionary form while preserving their semantic meaning. This helps in reducing vocabulary size and improving the quality of extracted features.

---

### Stop-Word Removal
Commonly occurring words that carry little semantic value (such as *is, the, and, in*) are removed using a predefined stop-word list. This step improves feature relevance by focusing on informative terms.

---

### Label Encoding
Categorical class labels associated with text samples are converted into numerical form using label encoding. This transformation is necessary for compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

---

### TF-IDF Feature Representation
The processed text is transformed into numerical vectors using **Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)**. TF-IDF assigns higher importance to words that are frequent in a document but rare across the corpus, resulting in more discriminative features.

---

## Output Artifacts
The following outputs are generated and saved:
- Cleaned and processed text dataset (CSV format)
- TF-IDF feature matrix
- Trained TF-IDF vectorizer
- Label encoder

These artifacts enable reproducibility and can be reused directly for model training or evaluation.

---

## Applications
- Text classification
- Sentiment analysis
- Document clustering
- Information retrieval
- NLP feature engineering pipelines

---

## Notes
This implementation provides a **standard and extensible baseline** for text preprocessing. It can be scaled to larger datasets and integrated with downstream machine learning or deep learning models as required.

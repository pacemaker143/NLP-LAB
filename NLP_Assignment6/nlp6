# Text Representation Techniques: BoW, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec

## Project Description
This project demonstrates fundamental **text representation techniques** used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The notebook implements **Bag-of-Words (BoW)** with raw frequency and normalized frequency, **TF-IDF**, and **Word2Vec embeddings** to transform textual data into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models.

The implementation is intended for academic use and provides a clear comparison between traditional sparse representations and dense vector embeddings.

## Techniques Implemented

### Bag-of-Words (BoW)
The Bag-of-Words model represents text by counting the occurrence of each word in a document.
- **Count Occurrence**: Raw frequency of terms in each document.
- **Normalized Count Occurrence**: Frequencies normalized using L1 normalization to represent relative importance within a document.

### TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)
TF-IDF extends Bag-of-Words by reducing the influence of commonly occurring words while emphasizing terms that are more informative across documents. This approach captures both local and global word importance.

### Word2Vec Embeddings
Word2Vec is a neural embedding technique that generates **dense vector representations** for words based on their contextual usage. Unlike BoW and TF-IDF, Word2Vec captures semantic relationships between words in continuous vector space.

## Workflow Summary
1. Text data is collected and preprocessed.
2. Bag-of-Words representations are generated using count and normalized frequencies.
3. TF-IDF vectors are computed for the same dataset.
4. Word2Vec is trained on tokenized text to obtain word embeddings.
5. Sample vectors are displayed for comparison.
